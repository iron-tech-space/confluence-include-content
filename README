This is the source code for the 'Create a Confluence Hellow World Macro' tutorial. 

You'll find the tutorial at: https://developer.atlassian.com/<tba>

Recommended Environment:

- Atlassian Plugin SDK 6.2.9
- AMPS Version 6.2.6
- Confluence Version 5.10.7

------

Here are the SDK commands you'll use immediately:

* atlas-run   -- installs this plugin into the product and starts it on localhost
* atlas-debug -- same as atlas-run, but allows a debugger to attach at port 5005
* atlas-cli   -- after atlas-run or atlas-debug, opens a Maven command line window:
                 - 'pi' reinstalls the plugin into the running product instance
* atlas-help  -- prints description for all commands in the SDK
